# Perséphone
----

Perséphone is a Web UI that allows you to search torrents on multiple torrent websites. It can then send the desired torrents to your favorite BitTorrent client's Web UI.

## TODO
----
* Add more search engines.
* Implement a more efficient data transfer API. (right now it's very inefficient)
* Chase down possible memory leaks as this is likely to run for long periods of times.
* Create a settings angular page allowing to tweak the UI and behavior of the application.
* Reduce memory footprint as much as possible.
* Add the ability to pause/resume/purge searches.
* Create init scripts for various operating systems and init systems.
